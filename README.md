# Wall_Painting_Robot
this is project is Arduino based wall paining Robot which can paint a wall on specific given distance interval. the main part of the system is DC Motors, Stepper Motor and Ultrasonic Sensor. the ultrasonic Sensor will be placed to the perpendicular wall of painted wall. the Robot always continues moving towards the perpendicular wall, but after some distance interval(10cm for this project) it will be stopped and the stepper Motor(which is placed to the parellel of painted wall) will be start painting. after the stepper painted that area, the Robot continues to move forward and this cycle continues.
